I am furious. FURIOUS. Not that I am sick, this was just random misfortune. Irritating, unpleasant and anxiety provoking, yes, but I am not furious at a microbe or my own immune system.

Tests where I live are being rationed. I cannot get tested unless I am hospitalized. I do not blame the city administrators who made set this policy. I know that this rationing allows for a more desperately ill individual to get a test they need.

I am furious because my city and the working people here who are not able to escape to their second homes are around me are paying the literal price with their lives and livelihoods for a half century of shortsighted ignorant people voting in anti-government legislators that are beholden to corporate interests.

Illness traces all the seams in our physical and social structures.

We are only as healthy as the most vulnerable members of our society.
