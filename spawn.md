### Part 1: Sign of the beast

I returned home from work a bit early on Monday, arriving just as naptime was ending.
When I opened the door, Annie our Nanny shouted a greeting from the far side of our railroad apartment. She was mid-diaper change, would I mind retrieving V from her crib?

I was surprised to hear playful gurgles coming from the popup travel crib in the master bedroom at the back of the floor-through apartment. V was an irritable sort of baby, prone to releasing hoarse wails at the slightest displeasure, like waking from a nap, but she sounded content on this approach. Perhaps she was maturing into a more peaceful sort.

Initially, we wedged a second crib into Otis' tiny bedroom, but the two babies cooed and squawked and kept each other awake. While my husband resented unfolding a pack and play every morning in our cramped bedroom, and I didn't love the smell V left when she invariably shit herself during her afternoon rest, at least my son could sleep in peace. What we do with small spaces.

I found the travel crib pushed up against our bookcase and Vera sitting at the bottom surrounded by a bent tarot deck. She was gnawing merrily at the corner of one card. Bending to scoop her up sent an blue twinge of pain through my lower abs, still not entirely healed from the C-section. V is unnaturally heavy. A beheamouth. Her tiny body is no larger than my sons but inexplicably so much more massive.

In my best cajoling mom voice, I lilted: 'Oh hey there V\_\_, do you have herself a card? Whose got a cool little card? Were you playing tarot? Are you gonna tell me my future V, What's my future?'

I held her on my left hip and straining again, I pryed a mangled card from her vise grip.

She grinned exposing 4 small sharp teeth at the center of a wide gummy slit and out dribbled out a few slobbery flakes of paper - horns, pentacles.

Ours was a floor-through apartment with the living room and baby's tiny bedroom along the street-facing wall. The full bedroom and kitchen were positioned in along the back of the building facing a small shared backyard. A windowless office united the two front and back halves of the apartment. It was a classically awkward New York layout with an the airline-sized bathroom just off the kitchen that allowed dinner guests to accoustically evaluate the strength of your urine stream.

### Part 2: Pooch's burden / fighting my instincts

The dog is suspect of her. growling. we build a barricade but he cries and growls.

All the while O loves her, enchanted giggles.

She's a perfectly nice baby. Cute, even. But I have an odd urge to off her at the first opportunity.

She is unnaturally heavy. A behemouth. Even when she went through a 3 week phase when she screamed inconsolably for 90 minute stretches punctuated by the guzzling of a bottle then projectile vomiting and explosivly shitting herself through her clothing and onto my non-toxic EVA foam Little Nomad playmat in _Jardin_.

this phase passes and I try to engage. I speak to her when I come home. She often reaches out a single pointer finger at me when I get home. I smile and take this as an invitation.

I touch our finger tips together and say 'boop!' She giggles. Perhaps we have passed into a realm of communication.
